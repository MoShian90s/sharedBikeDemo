 * @name MarkerWithLabel for V3\r\n  * @version 1.1.8 [February 26, 2013]\r\n  * @author Gary Little (inspired by code from Marc Ridey of Google).\r\n  * @copyright Copyright 2012 Gary Little [gary at luxcentral.com]\r\n  * @fileoverview MarkerWithLabel extends the Google Maps JavaScript API V3\r\n  *  <code>google.maps.Marker</code> class.\r\n  *  <p>\r\n  *  MarkerWithLabel allows you to define markers with associated labels. As you would expect,\r\n  *  if the marker is draggable, so too will be the label. In addition, a marker with a label\r\n  *  responds to all mouse events in the same manner as a regular marker. It also fires mouse\r\n  *  events and \"property changed\" events just as a regular marker would. Version 1.1 adds\r\n  *  support for the raiseOnDrag feature introduced in API V3.3.\r\n  *  <p>\r\n  *  If you drag a marker by its label, you can cancel the drag and return the marker to its\r\n  *  original position by pressing the <code>Esc</code> key. This doesn't work if you drag the marker\r\n  *  itself because this feature is not (yet) supported in the <code>google.maps.Marker</code> class.\r\n  */\r\n\r\n /*!\r\n  *\r\n  * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n  * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n  * You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n  *\r\n  *       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n  *\r\n  * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n  * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n  * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n  * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n  * limitations under the License.\r\n  */\r\n\r\n /*jslint browser:true */\r\n /*global document,google */\r\n\r\n /**\r\n  * @param {Function} childCtor Child class.\r\n  * @param {Function} parentCtor Parent class.\r\n  */\r\n function inherits(childCtor, parentCtor) {\r\n   /** @constructor */\r\n   function tempCtor() {};\r\n   tempCtor.prototype = parentCtor.prototype;\r\n   childCtor.superClass_ = parentCtor.prototype;\r\n   childCtor.prototype = new tempCtor();\r\n   /** @override */\r\n   childCtor.prototype.constructor = childCtor;\r\n }\r\n\r\n /**\r\n  * This constructor creates a label and associates it with a marker.\r\n  * It is for the private use of the MarkerWithLabel class.\r\n  * @constructor\r\n  * @param {Marker} marker The marker with which the label is to be associated.\r\n  * @param {string} crossURL The URL of the cross image =.\r\n  * @param {string} handCursor The URL of the hand cursor.\r\n  * @private\r\n  */\r\n function MarkerLabel_(marker, crossURL, handCursorURL) {\r\n   this.marker_ = marker;\r\n   this.handCursorURL_ = marker.handCursorURL;\r\n\r\n   this.labelDiv_ = document.createElement(\"div\");\r\n   this.labelDiv_.style.cssText = \"position: absolute; overflow: hidden;\";\r\n\r\n   // Set up the DIV for handling mouse events in the label.

The names of these\r\n  *  events are derived from the name of the property and are of the form <code>propertyname_changed</code>.\r\n  *  For example, if the content of the label changes, a <code>labelcontent_changed</code> event\r\n  *  is fired.\r\n  *  <p>\r\n  * @property {string|Node} [labelContent] The content of the label (plain text or an HTML DOM node).\r\n  * @property {Point} [labelAnchor] By default, a label is drawn with its anchor point at (0,0) so\r\n  *  that its top left corner is positioned at the anchor point of the associated marker. Use this\r\n  *  property to change the anchor point of the label. For example, to center a 50px-wide label\r\n  *  beneath a marker, specify a <code>labelAnchor</code> of <code>google.maps.Point(25, 0)</code>.\r\n  *  (Note: x-values increase to the right and y-values increase to the top.)\r\n  * @property {string} [labelClass] The name of the CSS class defining the styles for the label.\r\n  *  Note that style values for <code>position</code>, <code>overflow</code>, <code>top</code>,\r\n  *  <code>left</code>, <code>zIndex</code>, <code>display</code>, <code>marginLeft</code>, and\r\n  *  <code>marginTop</code> are ignored; these styles are for internal use only.\r\n  * @property {Object} [labelStyle] An object literal whose properties define specific CSS\r\n  *  style values to be applied to the label. Style values defined here override those that may\r\n  *  be defined in the <code>labelClass</code> style sheet. If this property is changed after the\r\n  *  label has been created, all previously set styles (except those defined in the style sheet)\r\n  *  are removed from the label before the new style values are applied.\r\n  *  Note that style values for <code>position</code>, <code>overflow</code>, <code>top</code>,\r\n  *  <code>left</code>, <code>zIndex</code>, <code>display</code>, <code>marginLeft</code>, and\r\n  *  <code>marginTop</code> are ignored; these styles are for internal use only.\r\n  * @property {boolean} [labelInBackground] A flag indicating whether a label that overlaps its\r\n  *  associated marker should appear in the background (i.e., in a plane below the marker).\r\n  *  The default is <code>false</code>, which causes the label to appear in the foreground.\r\n  * @property {boolean} [labelVisible] A flag indicating whether the label is to be visible.\r\n  *  The default is <code>true</code>. Note that even if <code>labelVisible</code> is\r\n  *  <code>true</code>, the label will <i>not</i> be visible unless the associated marker is also\r\n  *  visible (i.e., unless the marker's <code>visible</code> property is <code>true</code>).\r\n  * @property {boolean} [raiseOnDrag] A flag indicating whether the label and marker are to be\r\n  *  raised when the marker is dragged.
